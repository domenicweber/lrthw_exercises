> Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code? 

 Sometimes the questions are so simple I look too deep
 I'm assuming you mean to use `#` at the beginning of a line and it will comment out the line
 
 Wendy explained that you can highlight a line hold cmd + / and it will comment out the line.

called (octothorpe or pound character).

Octothorpe??? Really, yay for a new level of nerdom.  The # character "comments out" everything after it.
  
> Take your ex2.rb file and review each line going backward. 
 Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
  
I did find one typo, not sure what else I'm looking for

> Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

No I think I found them all.

>Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by 
its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

Yes, I found one more error reading it outloud.

### I have a question

Can you insert code after a comment on the same line?
