### Do More

> Add the code to chapter_3/ex3.rb.

#### Study Drills questions:

> 1)  Please make these changes in chapter_3/ex3.rb

Done

> 2)  Create a new file called irb_calculator.md.  Run 'irb' 
in your console, do some calculator stuff and then 
copy/paste your screen into irb_calculator.md.  
Bonus points for using markdown syntax(1) to make it look good.

Done

> 3)  Create a new Ruby file for this one

ex3.rb created, I think this is what you meant

>4)  Add your research to Readme.md

See Below 

>5)  Copy ex3.rb to ex3_floating.rb for this one.

Done: I do enjoy haveing exactly 97.00 roosters, I would not want a quarter of a rooster.
And now I have 6.75 eggs, that seems messy.


####My Notes

It's all pretty straight forward math. The only thing I'm not 100% on is
why use {} instead of ()?  Does is make a difference? Is {} a best practice b/c it's not in math
They technically mean something different when you are writing in math

The modulus thing he threw in was annoying, do you do this a lot in programming? 
I mean you do specify to use the remainder b/c it's just odd, most people just put the number.

I understand the irb is a funciton that allows you do to math 
directly in iTerm2 and doesn't require "puts" you just type in 
math and get answers...like a normal calculator

##### On Floats
The math "seems" wrong b/c most programming languages use integers without floats.
As we learned in the Learn to Program PDF you can't check 4.37 emails or have 6.75 eggs, so the program rounds up
