### Sutdy Drills

> 1) Copy ex5.rb to my_ex5.rb and make the requested changes

my_ex5.rb contains the {my_X} variables

2) Add a couple of format sequences, don't forget to add comments to 
explain what you're doing



Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to 
centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. 
Work out the math in Ruby.


#### My Notes

Rubocop doesn't like lines over 80. Zed's last line was over 90 so I broke it into 2 to my the cop happy.
