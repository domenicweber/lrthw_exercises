### Sutdy Drills

> 1) Copy ex5.rb to my_ex5.rb and make the requested changes

my_ex5.rb contains the {my_X} variables

> 2) Add a couple of format sequences, don't forget to add comments to 
explain what you're doing

Rubocop doesn't like lines over 80. Zed's last line was over 90 so I broke it into 2 to my the cop happy.
