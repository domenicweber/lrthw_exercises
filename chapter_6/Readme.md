###Study Drills:

> 1) Add your comments to ex6.rb

see ex6.rb

> 2) List these places in Readme.md

####In my exrb.6:

Lines 4, 12, 20, 22, AND 27

> 3) Was he lying?

This is an existential question: I don't know why he is lying, maybe he just likes lying.
I can tell you that there are not 4 places but 5 because a 
"string is a bit of text you want to display" and there are 5 occurences when we display
text and use other forms of displaying text to display text.
If that was confusing, good, that's how I feel all the time.

> 4) Add this explanation to Readme.md

The two strings w and e are written as variables, you can add variables together

> 5) Answer this in the Readme.md

I made a file called `single_quote_ex6.rb` that's all effed up
and Ruboguard hates it but I left it that way to show it doesn't work

You can't use single quotes when using variables because everything inside a single quote will be treated as text only.
Therefore we use double quotes to tell ruby "Hey there's stuff inside this string you need to look at"
Like my use of doulbe quotes >.>
