Interpolation appears to be a lot less typing.  It seems like you have to type everything twice in chapter 8.

If you just used different variables for lines 3, 4 and 5 you wouldn't have to redifine what first, second, third, fourth meant each time.

However, writing out line 6 would be a lot more work if you didn't define the variable 'formatter' at the begginning.
