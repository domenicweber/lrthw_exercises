## Engrish Questions

>What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.


>Please explain these three skills in your own words.

1. Coding requires a lot of keystrokes, many of which are around the edges of the keyboard.  
If you can't type, you are SOL. It goes w/o saying, you need to know how to read to type what you are reading.

2. One mistake in code and screw things up. Attn to detail is paramount.
Copying exactly is critical and helps me to develop best practices

3. I've already seen Jason look at something for 1/2 a second and say "You used 2x quotes instead of a single there" and I'm like
"WTF, I didn't even see that."  Being able to do this is a developed skill...one that I want.

>Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Memorization: square brackets or round, colon or semi-colon. The only way you will learn syntax is by typing, not copy/pasting.
This has as much to do with muscle memory in the fingers as actual memory.


>Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Again, muscle memory.  We're building new nerual pathways in the brain and this only happens through repetition.
"Anything worth doing is difficult at first." Programming is difficult at first, so it takes practice and repetion.
To get good at something you have to practice every day...ugh why are all the best things so hard :)
