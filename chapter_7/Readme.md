### Study Stuff

> 1) Add comments to ex7.rb

Did not comment on strings with text only

> 2) Read ex7.rb to one of you fellow students

3) Feel free to document the mistakes you make in Evernote. 

Done: mainly I have typos on =/+ and {}

> 4) ...

Hamburger

> 5) This is a lie, your instructor never makes mistakes. ;-)

Except for that one time, when he did that thing.


> Q) Please explain the difference between puts and print in your own words 
in the Readme.md.

Print appears to disregard line numbers.

`I can print here`

`and here`

`and here`

And it will all show up on the same line 

`I can print here and here and here`

Where as puts, puts it on a specific line

I also noted that prints will print before the command prompt, like it wasn't even there
